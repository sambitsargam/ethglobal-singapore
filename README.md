# **SecureFi: Privacy-Preserving Asset Sharing and DeFi Lending Platform**

**SecureFi** is a privacy-focused decentralized finance (**DeFi**) platform that enables **secure asset sharing** and **lending** using **Mina Protocol**, **Worldcoin**, and **Avail Tooling**. Users can share their financial portfolio with institutions for **loan approvals**, job applications, and other financial services, while maintaining full privacy through **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**. SecureFi also offers **USDC** and **MINA lending**, ensuring secure borrowing and lending transactions.

Additionally, SecureFi features a **transaction notifier** service that tracks transactions on the **Avail testnet** and sends real-time email notifications to users.

## **Features**

### **1. Secure Asset Sharing**
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Using **Mina Protocol**, users can securely share their financial portfolios without revealing sensitive data. Only authorized parties can access encrypted information.
- **Confidential Data Sharing**: Users maintain full control over who accesses their encrypted financial data, ensuring privacy at every step.

### **2. DeFi Lending**
- **USDC and MINA Lending**: Users can securely borrow and lend **USDC** and **MINA**, leveraging their financial portfolios for credit or loans, all while ensuring data privacy through **Mina Protocol**.
- **Privacy-Preserving Lending**: All lending transactions are secured with zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring that both lenders and borrowers can transact confidently without exposing sensitive financial information.

### **3. Decentralized Identity Verification**
- **Worldcoin Integration**: Verifies users’ identities through **Worldcoin’s decentralized identity system**, ensuring secure asset sharing and lending with trusted parties, while preserving privacy.

### **4. Transaction Notifier**
- **Real-Time Transaction Alerts**: A real-time **transaction notifier** that tracks transactions on the **Avail testnet** and sends email notifications to users when transactions occur.
- **Transaction Transparency**: Keep users updated on their transaction status without compromising privacy or security.

## **Usage**

- **Asset Sharing**: Connect your Mina wallet and securely share your financial portfolio with authorized institutions using **zero-knowledge proofs**.
- **DeFi Lending**: Borrow or lend **USDC** and **MINA** while keeping all transactions and data private.
- **Transaction Notifier**: Subscribe to transaction notifications for the Avail testnet and receive email alerts in real-time.
